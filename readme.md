# Last Stand

# Start session

```
/laststand start
```

Starts a new Last Stand session. The configured number of Hunters will receive a Hunter Tracking Device
with a selected target they need to hunt down before the end of the session. If the Hunter fails
they will lose a life.

# Reset session

```
/laststand reset
```

If anything goes wrong, `/laststand reset` will remove all Tracking devices from the inventories.
After running the command you can use `/laststand start` again to restart the session.
